            <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Â½ small red onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>8 medium tomatoes (about 500g), coarsely 
                        chopped and drained</li>
                    <li>2-3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                    <li>6-8 leaves of fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>30ml balsamic vinegar</li>
                    <li>60-80ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>60-80ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><h2>The step-by-step:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix the onions, tomatoes,
                         garlic and basil, taking care not to mash or 
                         break up the tomatoes too much. Add the balsamic
                          vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Add salt 
                          and pepper to taste. Mix again. Cover and chill
                           for at least an hour. This will allow the flavours
                            to soak and blend together.</li>
                    <li>Slice the baguette loaf diagonally into 12 thick
                         slices and lightly toast them until they are light
                         brown on both sides. Serve the mixture on 
                         the warm slices of bread. If you prefer the 
                         mixture at room temperature, remove from the fridge 
                         half an hour before serving.</li>
                </ol>
